# Secret Message in Image

A Python project that allows you to hide secret messages in images using steganography, encrypt/decrypt the messages using AES-256 encryption, and provide a user-friendly web interface built with Flask.

## Features
- **Steganography**: Hide secret messages in images using the Least Significant Bit (LSB) technique.
- **Encryption/Decryption**: Securely encrypt messages using AES-256 before hiding them in the image.
- **Web Interface**: A simple and responsive web interface for uploading images, entering messages, and extracting hidden messages.
- **Error Handling**: Proper error handling for invalid inputs and edge cases.
- **Support for Multiple Image Formats**: Works with JPEG, PNG, BMP, and other common image formats.

## Technologies Used
- **Python**: The core programming language.
- **Flask**: A lightweight web framework for the web interface.
- **Pillow**: A Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for image processing.
- **Cryptography**: A library for secure encryption and decryption.
